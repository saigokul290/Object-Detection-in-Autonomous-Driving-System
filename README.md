# Object Detection in Autonomous Driving System

This project implements an object detection system for autonomous driving using Arduino. The system is designed to recognize and respond to various objects on the road to ensure safe navigation.

## Introduction

This project aims to enhance the capabilities of autonomous driving systems by integrating an object detection mechanism using Arduino. The system uses sensors and cameras to detect objects and make driving decisions accordingly.

## Features

- Real-time object detection
- Integration with Arduino
- Efficient and lightweight
- Easy to set up and configure
